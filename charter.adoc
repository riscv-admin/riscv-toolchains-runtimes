= Charter of the RISC-V International Toolchains SIG
:toc:

Revision: 1.0

== Scope

The Toolchains SIG develops the strategy, identifies gaps, and prioritizes tasks for the software development environment used to build the RISC-V software ecosystem.

== Goals

The SIG's main goals are:

- Push RISC-V into open-source software
- Pull developers to the RISC-V ecosystem
- Advice on ISA extensions

To achieve these goals, the following steps are taken:

- Advice on ISA extensions and ensure that all future ISA extensions are driven by demonstrable/quantifiable benefits and possibly support them in development tools. Enable the SW HC to drive the ICs to develop extensions necessary to support the strategy.
- Identify and work with the key open-source projects for the RISC-V software ecosystem: compilers, debuggers, performance analysis tools, libraries implementing performance primitives, and memory management libraries.
- Liaise between open-source compiler developers and RISC-V task groups defining ISA, profiling, and debug extensions.
- Reach out to developers and decision-makers to contribute to the RISC-V ecosystem.
- Promote RISC-V as an ISA to be used for research into novel compilation techniques.
- Track the support for RISC-V across development tools.
- Support benchmarking and work with benchmark organizations.
- Benchmark development tools for RISC-V and provide reporting to internal RISC-V committees on the relative progress of development tools targeting RISC-V.
- Provide access to state-of-the-art development tools and compilation techniques for all RISC-V task groups by fostering an environment of cooperation between academia, open-source tool development, and the RISC-V ecosystem.
- Engage with new programming languages, programming paradigms, and development tool development towards the strategic goal of making RISC-V the prime choice ("First on RISC-V") for innovation in development tools.
