This page lists current identified gaps in the T&R ecosystem
as idenified by the RISC-V T&R group.

The gaps have the following properties:

* Title
* Tags
* Date
* Description
* Comparision to competition

The Tags help to structure the information.
Possible values are:

* psABI
* Compilers
* Runtimes
* Extension enablement
* Performance

To be able to reference the gap items, they are numbered from top to the bottom,
and the number of removed gaps is not reused. New gap items are appended to the list.

== Gaps ==

=== 1. Fine-grained cost model ===

* Tags: Compilers, Performance
* Date: 14.2.2022
* Description: The backend of GCC lacks a fine-grained cost model to optimize code generation for specific cores.
* Comparision to competion: Backends for other architectures (AArch64, PowerPC, x86-64) have that.

=== 2. I-func support ===

* Tags: Runtimes, Performance
* Date: 14.2.2022
* Description: Glibc offers an indirection mechanism to call target-specific implementations for functions like strlen, strcmp, memcmp. Upstream glibc does not untilize this mechanism and uses therefore unoptimized implementations.
* Comparison to competition: All other competitors utilize glibc's i-func support.

=== 3. Auto-vectorization ===

* Tags: Compilers, Performance
* Date: 14.2.2022
* Description: The (recently ratified) RISC-V vector extension allows to utilize and extend GCC's auto-vectorization capabilities. Currently, there is no (public information about) active work in this area.
* Comparison to competition: There has been quite some work on vectorization topics in the last 10 years in GCC. Initially much was focussed on x86. Recently AArch64 improved and extended the auto-vectorization capabilties of GCC with the integration of the SVE support.

=== 4. Basic vector support ===

* Tags: Compilers
* Date: 15.2.2022
* Description: The RISC-V vector extension needs basic support in GCC (compiler flags support, intrinsics support, tests).
* Comparison to competition: All other major architectures have vector support in upstream GCC.

=== 5. Embedded ABI ===

* Tags: psABI
* Date: 15.2.2022
* Description: There have been multiple attempts to establish an embedded ABI. In recent discussions a parameterized ABI has been proposed, which allows to provide a flexible ABI framework that's suitable for all needs.
* Comparision to competition: Most other architectures are not targeting low-end embedded devices, high-end servers, specialized systems (e.g. ML accelerators) and everything in-between.

=== 6. Go performance ===

* Tags: Compiler, Runtimes, Performance
* Date: 8.3.2022
* Description: The Golang lacks of optimize code generation for RISCV.
* Comparision to competion: Backends for other architectures (AArch64, PowerPC, x86-64) have that.
